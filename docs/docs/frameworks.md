# Overview

Amaterasu supports different processing frameworks to be executed. Amaterasu frameworks provides two main components for integrating with such frameworks:

 - **Dispatcher** 
 
   The dispatcher is in charge of creating and configuring a containers for actions of a specific framework. It makes sure that the executable and any dependencies are available in the container, as well as the environment configuration files, and sets the command to be executed.  
   
 - **Runtime Library**
   
   The runtime library provide an easy way to consume environment configuration and share data between actions. The main entry point for doing so is using the Amaterasu Context object. Amaterasu Context exposes the following functionality:
   
   **Note:** Each runtime (Java, Python, etc.) and framework have slightly different implementation of the Amaterasu context. To develop using a specific Framework, please consult the frameworks documentation bellow.
   
   - **Env**
      
    The env object contains the configuration for the current environment.
    
    
    

   - **Datasets and Dataset configuration**
    
    While [datasets](config/#datasets/) are configured under an environment, Amaterasu datasets are treated differently from other configurations, as they provide the integration point between different actions. Datasets can be either consumed as a configuration or to be loaded directly into an appropriate data structure for the specific framework and runtime.
